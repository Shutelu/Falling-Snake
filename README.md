# Falling Snakes - UPEC Project

A Java programming project for UPEC L3S5, Falling Snakes is a 2D grid game that challenges the player to take down descending snakes.

## Overview :</br>
In this game, a snake will start descending from the top of the grid, and the player must use a cannon to shoot the snake in order to win. There are destructible obstacles with different effects on the snake:

- Wood(Bois): Changes the snake's descent direction
- Strawberry(Fraise): Makes the snake longer
- Blueberry(Myrtille): Makes the snake invincible for a set time
- Gold Coin(Pi√®ce d'or): Changes the remaining obstacles' types randomly

The player can move the cannon with the A and D keys or arrow keys, and shoot with the space bar.

3. Compile the project by typing `javac App.java` <br>
4. Execute the game by typing `java App.java` <br>
